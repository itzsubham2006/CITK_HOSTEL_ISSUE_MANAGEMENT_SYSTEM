            <p class="citk-about-description">

               Students of CIT – Central Institute of Technology, Kokrajhar face numerous challenges in hostel life. Unfortunately, many complaints remain unheard, unresolved, or even unnoticed by the wardens and authorities. <br> <br>

                To address this gap, we, the students of CIT, have developed a smart hostel management website. This platform allows students to report their issues easily without any manual paperwork or repeated follow-ups. Everything is handled digitally, saving time and effort for both students and hostel staff.<br> <br>

                The website also enables authorities to receive direct feedback from students, monitor issues in real time, and take quicker, more effective action. With additional hostel-related facilities and transparent communication, this initiative aims to create a more responsive, efficient, and student-friendly hostel environment. <br> <br>

                The <strong>CITK Hostel Management System</strong> is a centralized digital
                platform designed to enhance hostel life at the Central Institute of Technology Kokrajhar.
                It focuses on transparency, accountability, and student well-being by
                streamlining communication between hostel residents and administration.
