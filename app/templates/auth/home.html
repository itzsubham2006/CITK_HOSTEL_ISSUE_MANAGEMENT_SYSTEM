                    The <strong>CITK Hostel Issue Management System</strong> is a centralized web-based
                    platform developed to efficiently manage and resolve hostel-related issues at the
                    <strong>Central Institute of Technology, Kokrajhar (CITK)</strong>.
                    The system aims to improve communication between hostel residents and hostel
                    authorities while ensuring transparency, accountability, and timely resolution
                    of reported problems.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Central Institute of Technology, Kokrajhar is a centrally funded technical institute
                    established by the Government of India to provide quality technical and vocational
                    education. As a residential campus, CITK accommodates students from diverse regions
                    across the country, making effective hostel administration a vital component of
                    campus life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Traditionally, hostel issues such as electrical faults, water supply problems,
                    sanitation concerns, maintenance requirements, and internet connectivity issues
                    were reported through manual or informal methods. These approaches often led to
                    delayed responses and lack of proper tracking. The Hostel Issue Management System
                    addresses these challenges by providing a structured digital mechanism for issue
                    reporting and monitoring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through this platform, students can submit detailed complaints and track their
                    resolution status in real time. Hostel wardens and administrators can review,
                    prioritize, and resolve issues efficiently using a centralized dashboard. This
                    streamlined workflow reduces administrative burden and improves overall hostel
                    service quality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The CITK Hostel Issue Management System reflects the institute’s commitment to
                    digital transformation, efficient governance, and student welfare. It contributes
                    to creating a safer, cleaner, and more comfortable living environment for hostel
                    residents.
